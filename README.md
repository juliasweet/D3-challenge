D3 Homework--Data Journalism and D3

For this assignment, I adapted the code from the final D3 class activity. 

I benefitted greatly from the guidance of several others. 

First, Brent Hillen, my tutor, helped me review the final D3 class activity so that I improved my understanding of D3 and how the various parts of the starter code fit together. This allowed me to effectively adapt this activity so that it worked with the starter code provided in the homework assignment. 

Secondly, Max Geisler, one of the TAs for my class suggested using Number() instead of + to ensure that the values in the csv columns were in integer form. 

Thirdly, I can credit two people for my ability to make display the state abbreviations in my bubbles: my classmate Ashley Karlsson, who sent me the snippet that she used in her code (and I adapted for mine) and Youa Thao, who provided some valuable suggestions on how to style my bubbles to make the abbreviations more readable.
